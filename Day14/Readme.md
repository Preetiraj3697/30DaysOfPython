# Higher Order Functions
In python functions are treated as first class citizens, allowing you to perform the following operations on functions:
- A function can take one or more functions as parameters
- A function can be returned as a result of another function
- A function can be modified
- A function can be assigned to a variable
  
In this section, we will cover:
1. Handling functions as parameters
2. Returning functions as return value from another functions
3. Using python closures and decorators
