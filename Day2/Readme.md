# Day2 Built in Functions

In python we have lots of built-in functions. Built-in functions are globally available for your use that mean you can make use of the built-in functions without importing or configuring. Some of the most commonly used python built-in functions are the following: print(), len(), type(), int(), float(), str(), input(), list(), dict(), min(), max(), sum(), sorted(), open(), file(), help() and dir().
In below you will see an exhaustive list of python built-in function taken from python documentation.
abs(),all(),any(),ascii(),bin(),filter(),input(),map(),hash(),set(),..etc.

# variables

Variables store data in a computer memory. Mnemonic variables are recommended to use in many programming languages. A mnemonic variable is a variable name that can be easily remembered and associated. A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored. Number at the beginning, special character, hyphen are not allowed when naming a variable. A variable can have a short name(like x, yx, x) but a more descriptive name(firstName,lastName,age,country) is highly recommended.

Python Variable Name Rules

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (firstname, Firstname, FirstName and FIRSTNAME) are different variables)
